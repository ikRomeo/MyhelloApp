	// we then create a struct to submint the commands called VkSubmitInfo
	// .sType it required for vulkan to know which type of struct it is dealing with

	//  GPU to GPU or GPU presentation Engine it's purpose is to regulate ordering
	//  operations across queues/pipelines making sure things do not start too early
	//  and avoiding race conditions in GPU execution
	//  so we assigne imageAvailableSemaphores which is also a VkSemaphore object with currentFrame to it

	//  index is VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OUTPUT_BIT which is final pixel blending and writing to framebuffer

	//   wait should take effect
	//  .commandBufferCount = 1 Number of command buffers to submit
	//  .pCommandBuffers array of command buffers the buffers contain the recorded GPU commands
	//   like draw calls,dispatch,barriers e.t.c in this case it is the rendering command
	//  signalSemaphore{] then we have to signal the GPU with renderFinishedSemaphores with the currentFrame as index
	//  that the command buffer has finished execution so that the CPU can present it safely
	//  notice that because the commandBufferCount is 1 the signalSemaphore count is also 1
	//  .pSignalSemaphores which is also ov type VkSemaphore handle is assigned the signalSemaphores array
	//  vkResetFences takes one more fences and resets them from signaled to unsignaled so it can be reused
	//  here it takes in the logical device(), the fenceCount which is 1 and VkFence handle
	//  then we submit the commands to the graphics pipeline via vkQueueSubmit
	//  vkQueueSubmit takes the device(), the number of batches of work we are submitting
	//  and the inFlightFences[currentFrame] which tells vulkan to associate fence with commands
	//  we just submitted.When the GPU finishes this submission, signal the fence to continue
	//  processing the next submission 
	//  remember that fence is CPU and semaphores is GPU synchronization
	//  to present the image into swapchain for rendering we need to create a VkpresentKHR struct
	//  we create the zero initialized struct
	//  .sType which is a must in vulkan before filling up any struct so vulkan know which type of struct it is
	//  .waitSemaphores there is only one semaphore to wait on
	//  .pWaitSemaphores wait until rendering is done
	//  .swapchainCount in our case is just 1
	//  .pSwapchain is a pointer to an array of VKSwapchainKHR handles 
	//  .pImageIndices image acquired earlier
	//   now we assign the vkQueuePresentKHR to result the arguments is

	//   that describes which semaphore we must wait on before presenting, which swapchain we are presenting to
	//   which image index of the swapchain we want to present and where to store it if needed

	// the swapchain images only provide color attachments(the image shown on screen)

	// we start by assigning findDepthFormat() of type VkFormat which is an enum and it picks a supported GPU format

	// for the swap chain/framebuffer
	// getSwapChainExtent wich is of type VkExtent2D matches the swapchain resolution, so the depth buffer is the same
	// size as the color image

	// depthImageMemory of type VkDeviceMemory handle is also an array that holds memory
	// depthImageView of type VkImageViews handle is also an array that holds image view per swapchain image
	// Each swapchain image need its own depth attachment, because multiple frames can be in flight
	// we now create the Depth Image by creating a zero initialized struct of VkImageCreateInfo

	// .imageType is the Dimensionality of the image
	// .extent.width is the width of the image

	// .mipLevels is the number of mipmap levels in the case because it is depth it is 1 
	//  if it was for textures we might use multiple mipmaps    
	// .arrayLayers is the number of layers in the image array for depth buffer is usually 1
	// .format specifies how pixel data is stored
	// .tiling which is memory layout preference here we are using optimal layout for GPU
	// .usage Bitmask of how the image will be used
	// .samples here we use VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_1_BIT for non-MSAA which is multisampling
	// .Controls ownership across queue families SHARING_MODE_EXCLUSIVE means owned by one queue family at a time
	// .bitmask of VkImageCreateFlagBits which is 0 for depth images
	// then we call createImageWithInfo which stores handle in depthImage[i] which is of type VkDeviceMemory handle
	// and its memory in depthImageMemorys[i] which is of type VkImageView handle
	// it creates the VkImage and allocates GPU memory via VkDeviceMemory , Device-local memory is fast GPU memory
	// which is not visible to CPU and perfect for depth
	// the next zero initialized struct is VkImageViewCreateInfo which describes how to create a view into an image
	// because images in Vulkan are raw memory witn no inherent interpretation An Image view tells vulkan how to 
	// access that image, its format,mipmap levels, array layers and component mapping
	// .sType is an enum that is required by vulkan to let it know which type of struct it is dealing with
	// .image is the handle to the image you're creating the view for in this case depthImage array of type
	//  VkImage handle at index i 
	// .viewType is how we want to view the image in this case it is VK_IMAGE_VIEW_TYPE_2D
	// .format which tell vulkan the pixel format for the view and it is of type Vkformat
	// the subresourceRange describes which part of the image the view will access
	// .subresourceRange.aspectMask tells vulkan which aspect of image of an image you want to work  with
	// in this case VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_DEPTH_BIT this selects the depth aspect of an image
	// .subresourceRange.baseMipLevel tells vulkan the first mipmap level to use in this case it is 0
	// .subresourceRange.levelCount is the number of mip levels in the case 1
	// .subresourceRange.baseArrayLayer First array layer to use in this case 0
	// .layerCount is the number of array layers in this case is 1
	// then we call vkCreateImageView with an if statement with arguments device.device() which is the logical device,
	// address to Viewinfo which is of type vkCreateImageView struct, pAllocator which is a pointer and we leave it
	// as a nullptr,depthImageViews of type VkImageView handle and check if it is succesfull else throw std error
